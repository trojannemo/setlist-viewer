## **📌 About**
**Setlist Viewer** is a **simple .NET MAUI application** for **Android** *(iOS support planned in the future)*.  

This app is a **companion to Nautilus' Setlist Manager**, which can be found **[here](https://github.com/trojannemo/Nautilus)**.  

🔹 **By itself, Setlist Viewer cannot function**—it requires a **Setlist file** created by **Nautilus' Setlist Manager**, either in:
- The native **`.setlist`** format  
- The web-friendly **`.json`** format  

🚀 **I'm sharing this on GitHub so others can contribute**, especially those with ideas beyond my current abilities!
