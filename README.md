# Setlist Viewer<br>

<br>
This is a very simple .NET MAUI application for Android (iOS should come at some point) designed to be a companion app to Nautilus' Setlist Manager (Nautilus can be found <a href="https://github.com/trojannemo/Nautilus">here</a>).<br>
By itself Setlist Viewer can't do anything - it requires a Setlist JSON file that Nautilus' Setlist Manager creates.<br>
<br>
Did I say this is a <b>SIMPLE</b> application? I'm putting it on GitHub so others who have given me ideas that are beyond my current abilities can help and contribute.<br>
<br>
Setlist Viewer was created using .NET 8 (LTS) and .NET MAUI in Visual Studio 2022 - you should probably be on the same if you want to work on Setlist Viewer yourself.<br>
<br>
# How To Install<br>
This is distributed as a signed Android APK file - you will need to download it to your Android device, make sure you enable 'Install applications from unknown sources' and then use a file manager to locate the APK and click on it to install.<br>
<br>
Click on the ? buttons found in Setlist Viewer for information on how to use - but it should be self explanatory.<br>
<br>
